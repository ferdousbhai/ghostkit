# `@summonghost/compaction`

Provider-neutral policy helpers and an xAI-native execution adapter for
conversation compaction.

```ts
import { decideConversationCompaction } from "@summonghost/compaction";

const action = decideConversationCompaction({
  estimatedTokens: 72_000,
  policy: {
    proactiveTokens: 64_000,
    hardLimitTokens: 96_000,
    headroomTokens: 8_000,
  },
});
```

The package also exports stable compaction keys and stale-write guards. It has
no runtime service and never owns provider credentials.

For stateful model loops, `createConversationCompactionController` owns
effective-history reconciliation and proactive-versus-blocking coordination.
Provider work stays behind injected callbacks:

```ts
const controller = createConversationCompactionController({
  policy,
  countInputTokens: ({ messages }) => tokenCounter(messages),
  createSnapshot: ({ messages, sequence }) =>
    summarizer({ messages, sequence }),
  applySnapshot: ({ snapshot }) => [renderSummary(snapshot)],
  scheduleCompaction: ({ run }) => backgroundQueue.enqueue(run),
});
```

`hardLimitTokens` is the threshold at which preparation must block; configure
it low enough that the provider call creating the snapshot can still accept its
source. After applying a blocking snapshot, the controller counts the
replacement and throws `ConversationCompactionLimitError` instead of returning
context that still reaches the hard limit.

The controller verifies that subsequent raw history extends the previously
observed prefix before appending only its suffix. Replaced, truncated, or
same-length-mutated history resets the effective view instead of reusing a stale
summary. If no scheduler is supplied, proactive compaction is skipped and the
controller waits for the blocking threshold.

Object messages should supply `messagesEqual`; the default `Object.is`
comparison treats re-created objects as a changed branch.

Once proactive work is accepted, the controller keeps that source marked
pending for the lifetime of the observed history branch. This prevents repeated
background scheduling before the consumer applies its durable checkpoint.
Background runs are invalidated when their observed history branch is replaced,
and a failed run releases the pending marker so a later preparation may
reschedule it. Preparation calls are serialized inside each controller.
`latestBlockingSnapshot()` reports only the snapshot applied synchronously;
background snapshots belong to the scheduler's durable lifecycle.

## xAI native compaction

`createXaiCompactionAdapter` owns xAI's `/tokenize-text` and
`/responses/compact` request bodies, opaque compaction-item validation, native
usage parsing, conservative preflight counting, and timeout signals. The
consumer injects an authenticated transport and therefore retains credentials,
gateway selection, request metadata, and billing:

```ts
import { createXaiCompactionAdapter } from "@summonghost/compaction";

const xaiCompaction = createXaiCompactionAdapter({
  request: ({ body, conversationId, path, signal }) =>
    fetch(`${configuredXaiBaseUrl}${path}`, {
      method: "POST",
      headers: {
        authorization: configuredAuthorization,
        "content-type": "application/json",
        ...(conversationId && { "x-grok-conv-id": conversationId }),
      },
      body: JSON.stringify(body),
      signal,
    }),
});

const result = await xaiCompaction.compactInput({
  model: "grok-4.5",
  items: nativeResponsesInput,
  conversationId,
});
```

The transport contract never receives or discovers an application API key. It
receives only the provider path, JSON body, optional conversation identifier,
and an abort signal. Native checkpoint persistence and conversion from
application messages remain consumer concerns.

Preflight tokenization measures serialized Responses input. Provider-side
expansion of files or other structured items is not observable through
`/tokenize-text`; consumers should carry forward known provider usage and
reserve model-appropriate headroom for those inputs.
